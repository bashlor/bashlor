# 👋 Hi there, I’m Elie!

Welcome to my GitHub profile ! Here, I document my learning journey, side projects, and continuous exploration of code quality and software architecture.

## 👨‍💻 About me

I’m a backend-leaning software developer with **3 years of experience** in .NET and Node.js ecosystems.  
As an INTJ, I thrive on strategy, autonomy, and building systems that last. My interests gravitate towards **Domain-Driven Design**, Clean Architecture, and delivering maintainable solutions, especially in complex or “legacy-heavy” environments.

Working in challenging contexts (legacy codebases, low documentation, and even toxic management) has forged my **resilience, independence, and drive for continuous improvement**.

## 🚀 What motivates me

- **Crafting robust, meaningful systems**: DDD, modular architectures, test automation, functional programming, Effect-TS…
    
- **Learning from every challenge**: I view every project, even the messy ones as a playground for growth.
    
- **Documenting & sharing**: I write docs, refactor, and publish as transparently as possible to help others (and my future self).
    

## 🔧 Tech Stack

- **Languages**: C# (.NET), TypeScript (Node.js), JavaScript
    
- **Frameworks**: ASP.NET Core, Node.js, React, Effect-TS
    
- **Databases**: PostgreSQL, SQL Server, MySQL
    
- **Tools**: Git, GitLab CI/CD, Docker
