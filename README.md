# 👋 Hi there, I’m Elie!

Welcome to my GitHub profile!

## Who am I?

I'm a passionate software developer, always on a journey to learn and grow.  
My path (including a challenging apprenticeship!) taught me resilience, autonomy, and a strong commitment to software quality. Today, I’m focused on **Domain-Driven Design** and software craftsmanship.

## What drives me

- **Learning:** Every experience — especially the tough ones — makes me a better developer.
- **Sharing:** I enjoy talking about best practices, clean code, and using tech to empower people.
- **Exploring:** Always curious about robust architectures, advanced testing, and healthy team cultures.

## Currently

- Working with legacy code (learning to make the most of it!). Refactoring, testing, and documentation are my daily routine.
- Deepening my skills in **DDD**, refactoring, and software architecture.
- Actively building my network and open to new opportunities — especially internationally.

## What I’m looking for

- Joining a team with a real tech culture focused on continuous improvement.
- Collaborating on meaningful, challenging projects.
- Open to **freelancing** or entrepreneurship, in France or abroad.

## Tech Stack

- **Languages:** C# (.NET), TypeScript (Node.js), JavaScript
- **Frameworks/Libraries:** ASP.NET Core, Node.js, Effect, React
- **Database:** PostgreSQL
- **Tools:** GitLab, CI/CD, unit testing, code analysis
