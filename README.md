# 👋 Hi there, I'm Elie!

Welcome to my GitHub profile! Here, I document my learning journey, side projects, and continuous exploration of code quality and software architecture.

## 👨‍💻 About me

I'm a backend-leaning software developer with **3 years of experience** in .NET and Node.js ecosystems.  
As an INTJ, I thrive on strategy, autonomy, and building systems that last. My interests gravitate towards **Domain-Driven Design**, Clean Architecture, and delivering maintainable solutions, especially in complex or "legacy-heavy" environments.

Working in challenging contexts (legacy codebases, low documentation, messy code) has forged my **resilience, independence, and drive for continuous improvement**.

## 🚀 What motivates me

- **Crafting robust, meaningful systems**: DDD, modular architectures, test automation, functional programming, Effect-TS…
- **Learning from every challenge**: I view every project, even the messy ones as a playground for growth.
- **Documenting & sharing**: I write docs, refactor, and publish as transparently as possible to help others (and my future self).
